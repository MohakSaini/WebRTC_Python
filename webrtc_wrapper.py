Usage Guide for WebRTC Video Streaming Application

This script implements a WebRTC-based video streaming application using a WebSocket
signaling server to exchange SDP and ICE candidates between a sender and a receiver.
The sender captures video from a camera or a stored video file and streams it to the
receiver, which displays the video in real-time and optionally saves it to a file.
When streaming a stored video file, the connection is automatically closed when the
video ends.

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or higher.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install aiortc websockets matplotlib opencv-python numpy
   ```
3. **Camera or Video File**: Ensure a camera is connected for live streaming or provide a valid video file path (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi`) for stored video streaming.
4. **Operating System**: Supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### How to Run
1. **Start the Signaling Server**:
   - The signaling server facilitates communication between the sender and receiver.
   - Run the following code in a Python script or terminal:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper

     async def main():
         wrapper = WebRTCWrapper()
         await wrapper.start_signaling_server()

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```
   - This starts the server on `ws://localhost:8765` (default port).
   - Keep this running in one terminal.

2. **Run the Sender**:
   - The sender streams video from a camera or a stored video file.
   - For a camera, run:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper

     async def main():
         wrapper = WebRTCWrapper()
         await wrapper.run_sender()

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```
   - For a stored video file (e.g., `video.mp4`), specify the source:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper

     async def main():
         wrapper = WebRTCWrapper(source="path/to/video.mp4")
         await wrapper.run_sender()

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```
   - If a stored video is used, the connection will automatically close when the video ends.

3. **Run the Receiver**:
   - The receiver displays the streamed video in a matplotlib window and can save it to a file.
   - Run:
     ```python
     import asyncio
     from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper

     async def main():
         wrapper = WebRTCWrapper(save_output=True)  # Set to True to save video
         await wrapper.run_receiver()

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```
   - A window will pop up displaying the video stream.
   - Press `q` in the display window to close it manually.
   - If `save_output=True`, the received video is saved as `received_output.avi`.
   - The receiver will automatically close when the sender's video ends (for stored videos).

### Running on the Same Machine
- You can run the signaling server, sender, and receiver on the same machine.
- Use separate terminal windows for each component.
- Ensure the `signaling_server_url` and `port` are consistent across all components (default: `ws://localhost:8765`, port `8765`).

### Running on Different Machines
- **Signaling Server**: Run the signaling server on a machine accessible to both sender and receiver.
  - Update the `signaling_server_url` in the sender and receiver to point to the server's IP address, e.g., `ws://192.168.1.100:8765`.
  - Ensure the port (e.g., `8765`) is open in the server's firewall.
- **Sender and Receiver**: Run the sender and receiver on separate machines, specifying the signaling server's URL:
  ```python
  wrapper = WebRTCWrapper(signaling_server_url="ws://192.168.1.100:8765")
  ```

### Notes
- **Video End Detection**: When streaming a stored video file, the sender monitors the video track's `readyState`. When the track ends (state changes from `live` to `ended`), the connection is automatically closed, and the receiver will also close its display window.
- **Timeout**: The sender and receiver wait up to 30 seconds for SDP messages. If no connection is established, they will timeout and exit.
- **Video Source**: The default camera is automatically selected based on the OS. For Linux, it uses `/dev/video0`; for macOS, `default:none`; for Windows, camera index `0`. Specify a video file path (e.g., `video.mp4`) for stored video streaming.
- **Saving Video**: Set `save_output=True` in the receiver to save the video as `received_output.avi` in the current directory.
- **Closing the Application**:
  - Receiver: Press `q` in the matplotlib window or send a `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) to the terminal. The receiver also closes automatically when the sender's video ends.
  - Sender: For stored videos, the connection closes automatically when the video ends. For live streams, use `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) to stop.
  - Signaling Server: Use `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) to stop.
- **Error Handling**: Check the console logs for errors (e.g., video file not found, camera not accessible, signaling server not reachable).

### Example Workflow
1. Open three terminals.
2. In Terminal 1, run the signaling server:
   ```bash
   python -c "import asyncio; from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper; asyncio.run(WebRTCWrapper().start_signaling_server())"
   ```
3. In Terminal 2, run the sender with a stored video:
   ```bash
   python -c "import asyncio; from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper; asyncio.run(WebRTCWrapper(source='path/to/video.mp4').run_sender())"
   ```
4. In Terminal 3, run the receiver:
   ```bash
   python -c "import asyncio; from webrtc_video_stream import WebRTCWrapper; asyncio.run(WebRTCWrapper(save_output=True).run_receiver())"
   ```
5. The video will stream, and the connection will close automatically when the video ends. Alternatively, press `q` in the receiver's window to exit early.

### Troubleshooting
- **Video File Not Found**: Ensure the video file path is correct and the file is accessible. Supported formats include `.mp4`, `.avi`, etc.
- **Camera Not Found**: Ensure the camera is connected and the `source` is correct. On Linux, list devices with `ls /dev/video*`. On Windows, try different indices (e.g., `0`, `1`).
- **Signaling Server Not Reachable**: Verify the server is running and the URL/port are correct. Check firewall settings if on different machines.
- **No Video Display**: Ensure the sender is running before the receiver, and the signaling server is active.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed (`aiortc`, `websockets`, etc.).

This application provides a simple way to stream video over WebRTC, with automatic connection closure for stored video files.
